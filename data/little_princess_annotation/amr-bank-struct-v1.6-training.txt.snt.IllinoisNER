And	O
he	O
sat	O
down	O

because	O
he	O
was	O
afraid	O

Then	O
he	O
said	O

again	O

"	O
You	O
know	O

my	O
flower	O

I	O

And	O
she	O
is	O

She	O
is	O

She	O
has	O
four	O

"	O

I	O
too	O
sat	O
down	O

There	O

He	O
still	O

then	O
he	O
got	O
up	O

He	O
took	O
one	O
step	O

I	O
could	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O

a	O

And	O
now	O
six	O
years	O
have	O
already	O
gone	O
by	O
..	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
yet	O
told	O
this	O
story	O
.	O

The	O
companions	O
who	O
met	O
me	O
on	O
my	O
return	O
were	O
well	O
content	O
to	O
see	O
me	O
alive	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
sad	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
:	O
"	O
I	O
am	O
tired	O
.	O
"	O

Now	O
my	O
sorrow	O
is	O
comforted	O
a	O
little	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
-	O
-	O
not	O
entirely	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
his	O
planet	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
his	O
body	O
at	O
daybreak	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
heavy	O
body	O
...	O
and	O
at	O
night	O
I	O
love	O
to	O
listen	O
to	O
the	O
stars	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
like	O
five	O
hundred	O
million	O
little	O
bells	O
..	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
extraordinary	O
thing	O
...	O
when	O
I	O
drew	O
the	O
muzzle	O
for	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
,	O
I	O
forgot	O
to	O
add	O
the	O
leather	O
strap	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
will	O
never	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
fasten	O
it	O
on	O
his	O
sheep	O
.	O

So	O
now	O
I	O
keep	O
wondering	O
:	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
on	O
his	O
planet	O
?	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
sheep	O
has	O
eaten	O
the	O
flower	O
..	O
.	O

At	O
one	O
time	O
I	O
say	O
to	O
myself	O
:	O
"	O
Surely	O
not	O
!	O

The	O
little	O
prince	O
shuts	O
his	O
flower	O
under	O
her	O
glass	O
globe	O
every	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
watches	O
over	O
his	O
sheep	O
very	O
carefully	O
..	O
.	O
"	O

Then	O
I	O
am	O
happy	O
.	O

And	O
there	O
is	O
sweetness	O
in	O
the	O
laughter	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
stars	O
.	O

But	O
at	O
another	O
time	O
I	O
say	O
to	O
myself	O
:	O
"	O
At	O
some	O
moment	O
or	O
other	O
one	O
is	O
absent	O
-	O
minded	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
enough	O
!	O

On	O
some	O
one	O
evening	O
he	O
forgot	O
the	O
glass	O
globe	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
sheep	O
got	O
out	O
,	O
without	O
making	O
any	O
noise	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
..	O
.	O
"	O

And	O
then	O
the	O
little	O
bells	O
are	O
changed	O
to	O
tears	O
..	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
mystery	O
.	O

For	O
you	O
who	O
also	O
love	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
nothing	O
in	O
the	O
universe	O
can	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
if	O
somewhere	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
where	O
,	O
a	O
sheep	O
that	O
we	O
never	O
saw	O
has	O
-	O
-	O
yes	O
or	O
no	O
?	O
--	O
eaten	O
a	O
rose	O
..	O
.	O

Look	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
sky	O
.	O

Ask	O
yourselves	O
:	O
is	O
it	O
yes	O
or	O
no	O
?	O

Has	O
the	O
sheep	O
eaten	O
the	O
flower	O
?	O

And	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
how	O
everything	O
changes	O
..	O
.	O

And	O
no	O
grown	O
-	O
up	O
will	O
ever	O
understand	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
so	O
much	O
importance	O
!	O

This	O
is	O
,	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
the	O
loveliest	O
and	O
saddest	O
landscape	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
preceding	O
page	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
drawn	O
it	O
again	O
to	O
impress	O
it	O
on	O
your	O
memory	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
here	O
that	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
appeared	O
on	O
Earth	O
,	O
and	O
disappeared	O
.	O

Look	O
at	O
it	O
carefully	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
recognise	O
it	O
in	O
case	O
you	O
travel	O
some	O
day	O
to	O
the	O
African	B-MISC
desert	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
should	O
come	O
upon	O
this	O
spot	O
,	O
please	O
do	O
not	O
hurry	O
on	O
.	O

Wait	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
exactly	O
under	O
the	O
star	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
little	O
man	O
appears	O
who	O
laughs	O
,	O
who	O
has	O
golden	O
hair	O
and	O
who	O
refuses	O
to	O
answer	O
questions	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
know	O
who	O
he	O

If	O
this	O
