I	O
had	O
thus	O
learned	O
a	O
second	O
fact	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
planet	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
came	O
from	O
was	O
scarcely	O
any	O
larger	O
than	O
a	O
house	O
!	O

But	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
really	O
surprise	O
me	O
much	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
that	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
planets	O
--	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
Earth	B-LOC
,	O
Jupiter	O
,	O
Mars	B-PER
,	O
Venus	B-PER
--	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
given	O
names	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
also	O
hundreds	O
of	O
others	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
are	O
so	O
small	O
that	O
one	O
has	O
a	O
hard	O
time	O
seeing	O
them	O
through	O
the	O
telescope	O
.	O

When	O
an	O
astronomer	O
discovers	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
name	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
a	O
number	O
.	O

He	O
might	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
"	O
Asteroid	B-MISC
325	I-MISC
.	O
"	O

I	O
have	O
serious	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
planet	O
from	O
which	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
came	O
is	O
the	O
asteroid	O
known	O
as	O
B-612	B-ORG
.	O

This	O
asteroid	O
has	O
only	O
once	O
been	O
seen	O
through	O
the	O
telescope	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
by	O
a	O
Turkish	B-MISC
astronomer	O
,	O
in	O
1909	O
.	O

On	O
making	O
his	O
discovery	O
,	O
the	O
astronomer	O
had	O
presented	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
International	B-ORG
Astronomical	I-ORG
Congress	I-ORG
,	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
demonstration	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
Turkish	B-MISC
costume	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
nobody	O
would	O
believe	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
.	O

Grown	O
-	O
ups	O
are	O
like	O
that	O
..	O
.	O

Fortunately	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
reputation	O
of	O
Asteroid	B-PER
B-612	I-PER
,	O
a	O
Turkish	B-MISC
dictator	O
made	O
a	O
law	O
that	O
his	O
subjects	O
,	O
under	O
pain	O
of	O
death	O
,	O
should	O
change	O
to	O
European	B-MISC
costume	O
.	O

So	O
in	O
1920	O
the	O
astronomer	O
gave	O
his	O
demonstration	O
all	O
over	O
again	O
,	O
dressed	O
with	O
impressive	O
style	O
and	O
elegance	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
time	O
everybody	O
accepted	O
his	O
report	O
.	O

If	O
I	O
have	O
told	O
you	O
these	O
details	O
about	O
the	O
asteroid	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
note	O
of	O
its	O
number	O
for	O
you	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O

their	O
ways	O

WHen	O
you	O
tell	O
them	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
new	O
friend	O

they	O
never	O
ask	O
you	O
any	O

They	O

from	O
these	O

they	O
think	O
they	O
have	O
learned	O
anything	O
about	O
him	O

If	O
you	O
were	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
the	O
grown	O
-	O
ups	O
:	O
"	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
beautiful	O
house	O
made	O

with	O

in	O
the	O

on	O

"	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
any	O
idea	O
of	O
that	O
house	O
at	O

You	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
to	O

"	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
house	O
that	O
cost	O
$	O
20,000	O

"	O

Then	O
they	O
would	O
exclaim	O
:	O
"	O
Oh	O
,	O
what	O
a	O
pretty	O
house	O
that	O
is	O

"	O

Just	O
so	O
,	O
you	O
might	O
say	O
to	O
them	O
:	O
"	O
The	O
proof	O
that	O

that	O
he	O
laughed	O

and	O
that	O

If	O

that	O

a	O

And	O
what	O
good	O
would	O
it	O

would	O

then	O
they	O

leave	O
you	O

from	O
their	O

One	O
must	O

Children	O

But	O
certainly	O

for	O

is	O

As	O
each	O
day	O
passed	O
I	O
would	O
learn	O

in	O
our	O
talk	O

something	O
about	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O

planet	O
,	O
his	O
departure	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
his	O
journey	O

The	O
information	O
would	O
come	O
very	O
slowly	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
might	O
chance	O
to	O
fall	O
from	O
his	O
thoughts	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
that	O
I	O
heard	O

on	O
the	O
third	O
day	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
catastrophe	O
of	O
the	O
baobabs	O

This	O
time	O
,	O
once	O
more	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
sheep	O
to	O
thank	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
asked	O
me	O
abruptly	O
--	O
as	O
if	O
seized	O
by	O
a	O
grave	O
doubt	O
--	O
"	O
It	O
is	O

"	O
Ah	O

glad	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

why	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
important	O
that	O
sheep	O
should	O
eat	O
little	O
bushes	O

But	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
added	O
:	O
"	O
Then	O
it	O
follows	O
that	O
they	O
also	O
eat	O
baobabs	O

"	O

I	O
pointed	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
that	O
baobabs	O
were	O
not	O
little	O
bushes	O

but	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O

trees	O
as	O
big	O

that	O

took	O
a	O
whole	O
herd	O
of	O

away	O

him	O
,	O
the	O
herd	O
would	O
not	O
eat	O
up	O
one	O
single	O
baobab	O

The	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
herd	O
of	O
elephants	O
made	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
laugh	O

"	O
We	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
them	O

he	O
said	O

But	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
wise	O
comment	O
:	O
"	O
Before	O
they	O

the	O

something	O

was	O
self	O

evident	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
great	O
mental	O
effort	O
to	O
solve	O
this	O
problem	O

without	O
any	O
assistance	O

Indeed	O

as	O
I	O
learned	O

there	O
were	O

the	O

the	O

good	O

In	O

bad	O
seeds	O
from	O

until	O
some	O
one	O

is	O
seized	O
with	O
the	O
desire	O

Then	O
this	O

will	O
stretch	O
itself	O

begin	O
--	O
timidly	O
at	O
first	O

to	O
push	O
a	O
charming	O
little	O

inoffensively	O
upward	O
toward	O

If	O
it	O

the	O

a	O

bush	O

would	O
let	O

when	O
it	O

must	O
destroy	O

that	O

if	O
the	O

a	O
question	O

the	O

prince	O
said	O

"	O
When	O
you	O
've	O
finished	O
your	O
own	O
toilet	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
is	O
time	O
to	O
attend	O
to	O
the	O
toilet	O
of	O
your	O
planet	O
,	O
just	O
so	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
care	O
.	O

You	O
must	O
see	O
to	O
it	O
that	O
you	O
pull	O
up	O
regularly	O
all	O
the	O
baobabs	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
first	O
moment	O
when	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
distinguished	O
from	O
the	O
rosebushes	O
which	O
they	O
resemble	O
so	O
closely	O
in	O
their	O
earliest	O
youth	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
tedious	O
work	O
,	O
"	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
added	O
,	O
"	O
but	O
very	O
easy	O
.	O
"	O

And	O
one	O
day	O
he	O
said	O
to	O
me	O
:	O
"	O
You	O
ought	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
beautiful	O
drawing	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
children	O
where	O
you	O
live	O
can	O
see	O
exactly	O
how	O
all	O
this	O
is	O

That	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
useful	O
to	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
travel	O
some	O
day	O

Sometimes	O
,	O
"	O
he	O
added	O

"	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
harm	O
in	O
putting	O
off	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
work	O
until	O
another	O
day	O

But	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
baobabs	O
,	O
that	O
always	O
means	O
a	O
catastrophe	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
a	O
planet	O
that	O
was	O
inhabited	O
by	O
a	O
lazy	O
man	O

He	O
neglected	O
three	O
little	O
bushes	O
..	O
.	O
"	O

So	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
described	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
drawing	O
of	O
that	O
planet	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
much	O
like	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
tone	O
of	O
a	O
moralist	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
the	O
baobabs	O
is	O
so	O
little	O
understood	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
considerable	O
risks	O
would	O
be	O
run	O
by	O
anyone	O
who	O
might	O
get	O
lost	O
on	O
an	O
asteroid	O
,	O
that	O
for	O

I	O
am	O
breaking	O

Children	O

I	O
say	O
plainly	O
,	O
"	O
watch	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
baobabs	O
!	O
"	O

My	O
friends	O

like	O
myself	O

have	O
been	O
skirting	O
this	O
danger	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
,	O
without	O
ever	O
knowing	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
worked	O
so	O
hard	O
over	O
this	O
drawing	O
.	O

The	O
lesson	O
which	O
I	O
pass	O
on	O
by	O
this	O
means	O
is	O
worth	O
all	O
the	O
trouble	O
it	O
has	O
cost	O
me	O

Perhaps	O
you	O
will	O
ask	O
me	O
,	O
"	O
Why	O
are	O
there	O
no	O
other	O
drawing	O
in	O
this	O
book	O
as	O
magnificent	O
and	O
impressive	O
as	O
this	O
drawing	O
of	O
the	O
baobabs	O
?	O
"	O

The	O
reply	O
is	O
simple	O

I	O
have	O
tried	O
.	O

But	O
with	O
the	O
others	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
successful	O

When	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
drawing	O
of	O
the	O
baobabs	O
I	O
was	O
carried	O
beyond	O
myself	O
by	O
the	O

force	O
of	O
urgent	O
necessity	O

Bit	O
by	O

I	O
came	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
secrets	O
of	O
your	O
sad	O
little	O
life	O
..	O
.	O

For	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
you	O
had	O
found	O
your	O
only	O
entertainment	O
in	O
the	O
quiet	O
pleasure	O
of	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
sunset	O

I	O
learned	O
that	O
new	O
detail	O
on	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
fourth	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
said	O
to	O
me	O

"	O
I	O

very	O

Come	O

us	O

at	O
a	O

For	O

"	O

"	O
For	O
the	O
sunset	O

We	O
must	O
wait	O
until	O
it	O
is	O
time	O

"	O

At	O
first	O
you	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
much	O
surprised	O

And	O
then	O
you	O
laughed	O
to	O
yourself	O

You	O
said	O
to	O
me	O

"	O
I	O

If	O

to	O

in	O
one	O

you	O
could	O
go	O
straight	O
into	O
the	O

from	O
noon	O

Unfortunately	O
