Once	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
six	O
years	O
old	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
magnificent	O
picture	O
in	O
a	O
book	O
,	O
called	O
True	B-MISC
Stories	I-MISC
from	O
Nature	B-MISC
,	O
about	O
the	O
primeval	O
forest	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
picture	O
of	O
a	O
boa	O
constrictor	O
in	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
swallowing	O
an	O
animal	O
.	O

Here	O
is	O
a	O
copy	O
of	O
the	O
drawing	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
book	O
it	O
said	O
:	O
"	O
Boa	O
constrictors	O
swallow	O
their	O
prey	O
whole	O
,	O
without	O
chewing	O
it	O
.	O

After	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
move	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
sleep	O
through	O
the	O
six	O
months	O
that	O
they	O
need	O
for	O
digestion	O
.	O
"	O

I	O
pondered	O
deeply	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
adventures	O
of	O
the	O
jungle	O
.	O

And	O
after	O
some	O
work	O
with	O
a	O
colored	O
pencil	O
I	O
succeeded	O
in	O
making	O
my	O
first	O
drawing	O
.	O

My	O
Drawing	O
Number	O
One	O
.	O

It	O
looked	O
like	O
this	O
:	O
I	O
showed	O
my	O
masterpiece	O
to	O
the	O
grown	O
-	O
ups	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
them	O
whether	O
the	O
drawing	O
frightened	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
answered	O
:	O
"	O
Frighten	O
?	O

Why	O
should	O
any	O
one	O
be	O
frightened	O
by	O
a	O
hat	O
?	O
"	O

My	O
drawing	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
picture	O
of	O
a	O
hat	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
picture	O
of	O
a	O
boa	O
constrictor	O
digesting	O
an	O
elephant	O
.	O

But	O
since	O
the	O
grown	O
-	O
ups	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
understand	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
another	O
drawing	O
:	O
I	O
drew	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
boa	O
constrictor	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
grown	O
-	O
ups	O
could	O
see	O
it	O
clearly	O
.	O

They	O
always	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
things	O
explained	O
.	O

My	O
Drawing	O
Number	O
Two	O
looked	O
like	O
this	O
:	O
The	O
grown	O
-	O
ups	O
'	O
response	O
,	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
advise	O
me	O
to	O
lay	O
aside	O
my	O
drawings	O
of	O
boa	O
constrictors	O
,	O
whether	O
from	O
the	O
inside	O
or	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
and	O
devote	O
myself	O
instead	O
to	O
geography	O
,	O
history	O
,	O
arithmetic	O
and	O
grammar	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
six	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
up	O
what	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
magnificent	O
career	O
as	O
a	O
painter	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
disheartened	O
by	O
the	O
failure	O
of	O
my	O
Drawing	O
Number	O
One	O
and	O
my	O
Drawing	O
Number	O
Two	O
.	O

Grown	O
-	O
ups	O
never	O
understand	O
anything	O
by	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
tiresome	O
for	O
children	O
to	O
be	O
always	O
and	O
forever	O
explaining	O
things	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
chose	O
another	O
profession	O
,	O
and	O
learned	O
to	O
pilot	O
airplanes	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
flown	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
geography	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
useful	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

At	O
a	O
glance	O
I	O
can	O
distinguish	O
China	B-LOC
from	O
Arizona	B-LOC

If	O
one	O
gets	O
lost	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
such	O
knowledge	O
is	O
valuable	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
life	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
encounters	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
people	O
who	O
have	O
been	O
concerned	O
with	O
matters	O
of	O
consequence	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
lived	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
among	O
grown	O
-	O
ups	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
seen	O
them	O
intimately	O
,	O
close	O
at	O
hand	O
.	O

And	O
that	O
has	O
n't	O
much	O
improved	O
my	O
opinion	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

Whenever	O
I	O
met	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
at	O
all	O
clear	O
-	O
sighted	O
,	O
I	O
tried	O
the	O
experiment	O
of	O
showing	O
him	O
my	O
Drawing	O
Number	O
One	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
kept	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
try	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
person	O
of	O
true	O
understanding	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
whoever	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
he	O
,	O
or	O
she	O
,	O
would	O
always	O
say	O
:	O
"	O
That	O
is	O
a	O
hat	O
.	O
"	O

Then	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
talk	O
to	O
that	O
person	O
about	O
boa	O
constrictors	O
,	O
or	O
primeval	O
forests	O
,	O
or	O
stars	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
bring	O
myself	O
down	O
to	O
his	O
level	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
talk	O
to	O
him	O
about	O
bridge	O
,	O
and	O
golf	O
,	O
and	O
politics	O
,	O
and	O
neckties	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
grown	O
-	O
up	O
would	O
be	O
greatly	O
pleased	O
to	O
have	O
met	O
such	O
a	O
sensible	O
man	O

So	O
I	O
lived	O
my	O
life	O
alone	O
,	O
without	O
anyone	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
really	O
talk	O
to	O
,	O
until	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
accident	O
with	O
my	O
plane	O
in	O
the	O
Desert	B-LOC
of	O
Sahara	B-LOC
,	O
six	O
years	O
ago	O
.	O

Something	O
was	O
broken	O
in	O
my	O
engine	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
me	O
neither	O
a	O
mechanic	O
nor	O
any	O
passengers	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
myself	O
to	O
attempt	O
the	O
difficult	O
repairs	O
all	O
alone	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
question	O
of	O
life	O
or	O
death	O
for	O
me	O
:	O
I	O
had	O
scarcely	O
enough	O
drinking	O
water	O
to	O
last	O
a	O
week	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
night	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
sleep	O
on	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
a	O
thousand	O
miles	O
from	O
any	O
human	O
habitation	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
more	O
isolated	O
than	O
a	O
shipwrecked	O
sailor	O
on	O
a	O
raft	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
ocean	O
.	O

Thus	O
you	O
can	O
imagine	O
my	O
amazement	O
,	O
at	O
sunrise	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
awakened	O
by	O
an	O
odd	O
little	O
voice	O
.	O

It	O
said	O
:	O
"	O

you	O

I	O
jumped	O
to	O
my	O
feet	O
,	O
completely	O
thunderstruck	O
.	O

I	O
blinked	O
my	O
eyes	O
hard	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
carefully	O
all	O
around	O
me	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
most	O
extraordinary	O
small	O
person	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
there	O
examining	O
me	O
with	O
great	O
seriousness	O
.	O

Here	O
you	O
may	O
see	O
the	O
best	O
portrait	O
that	O
,	O
later	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
drawing	O
is	O
certainly	O
very	O
much	O
less	O
charming	O
than	O
its	O
model	O
.	O

That	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
is	O
not	O
my	O
fault	O
.	O

The	O
grown	O
-	O
ups	O
discouraged	O
me	O
in	O
my	O
painter	O
's	O
career	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
six	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
never	O
learned	O
to	O
draw	O
anything	O
,	O
except	O
boas	O
from	O
the	O
outside	O
and	O
boas	O
from	O
the	O
inside	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
stared	O
at	O
this	O
sudden	O
apparition	O
with	O
my	O
eyes	O
fairly	O
starting	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
head	O
in	O
astonishment	O
.	O

Remember	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
crashed	O
in	O
the	O
desert	O
a	O
thousand	O
miles	O
from	O
any	O
inhabited	O
region	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
my	O
little	O
man	O
seemed	O
neither	O
to	O
be	O
straying	O
uncertainly	O
among	O
the	O
sands	O
,	O
nor	O
to	O
be	O
fainting	O
from	O
fatigue	O
or	O
hunger	O
or	O
thirst	O
or	O
fear	O
.	O

Nothing	O
about	O
him	O
gave	O
any	O
suggestion	O
of	O
a	O
child	O
lost	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
desert	O
,	O
a	O
thousand	O
miles	O
from	O
any	O
human	O
habitation	O
.	O

When	O
at	O
last	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
speak	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
:	O
"	O
But	O
--	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
doing	O
here	O
?	O
"	O

And	O
in	O
answer	O
he	O
repeated	O
,	O
very	O
slowly	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
were	O
speaking	O
of	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
great	O
consequence	O
:	O
"	O
If	O
you	O
please	O

When	O
a	O
mystery	O
is	O
too	O
overpowering	O
,	O
one	O
dare	O
not	O
disobey	O
.	O

Absurd	O
as	O
it	O
might	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
a	O
thousand	O
miles	O
from	O
any	O
human	O
habitation	O
and	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
death	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
pocket	O
a	O
sheet	O
of	O
paper	O
and	O
my	O
fountain	O
-	O
pen	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
I	O
remembered	O
how	O
my	O
studies	O
had	O
been	O
concentrated	O
on	O
geography	O
,	O
history	O
,	O
arithmetic	O
,	O
and	O
grammar	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
little	O
chap	O
(	O
a	O
little	O
crossly	O
,	O
too	O
)	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
me	O
:	O
"	O
That	O
does	O
n't	O
matter	O
.	O

Draw	O
me	O
a	O
sheep	O
..	O
.	O
"	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
drawn	O
a	O
sheep	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
drew	O
for	O
him	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
pictures	O
I	O
had	O
drawn	O
so	O
often	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
boa	O
constrictor	O
from	O
the	O
outside	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
astounded	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
little	O
fellow	O
greet	O
it	O
with	O
,	O
"	O
No	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
no	O
!	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
an	O
elephant	O
inside	O
a	O
boa	O
constrictor	O

A	O
boa	O
constrictor	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
dangerous	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
elephant	O
is	O
very	O
cumbersome	O
.	O

Where	O
I	O
live	O
,	O
everything	O
is	O
very	O
small	O
.	O

What	O
I	O
need	O
is	O
a	O
sheep	O
.	O

Draw	O
me	O
a	O
sheep	O
.	O
"	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
drawing	O
.	O

He	O
looked	O
at	O
it	O
carefully	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
said	O
:	O
"	O
No	O
.	O

This	O
sheep	O
is	O
already	O
very	O
sickly	O
.	O

Make	O
me	O
another	O

"	O

So	O
I	O
made	O
another	O
drawing	O

My	O
friend	O
smiled	O
gently	O
and	O
indulgently	O
.	O

"	O
You	O
see	O
yourself	O
,	O
"	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
"	O
that	O
this	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
ram	O

has	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
did	O
my	O
drawing	O
over	O
once	O
more	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
rejected	O
too	O
,	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
others	O

"	O
This	O
one	O
is	O
too	O
old	O

I	O
want	O
a	O
sheep	O
that	O
will	O
live	O
a	O
long	O
time	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
my	O
patience	O
was	O
exhausted	O

because	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
to	O
start	O
taking	O
my	O
engine	O
apart	O

So	O
I	O
tossed	O
off	O
this	O
drawing	O

And	O
I	O
threw	O
out	O
an	O
explanation	O
with	O
it	O

"	O
This	O
is	O
only	O

was	O

he	O

me	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
proud	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
learn	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
fly	O

He	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
then	O
:	O
"	O
What	O
!	O

You	O
dropped	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
sky	O

"	O

"	O
Yes	O

I	O
answered	O
,	O
modestly	O

"	O
Oh	B-LOC

That	O
is	O
funny	O

And	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
broke	O
into	O
a	O
lovely	O
peal	O
of	O
laughter	O
,	O
which	O
irritated	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
.	O

I	O
like	O
my	O
misfortunes	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
seriously	O

Then	O
he	O
added	O
:	O
"	O
So	O
you	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
sky	O

Which	O
is	O
your	O
planet	O

"	O

At	O
that	O
moment	O
I	O
caught	O
a	O
gleam	O
of	O
light	O
in	O
the	O
impenetrable	O
mystery	O
of	O
his	O
presence	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
demanded	O
,	O
abruptly	O
:	O
"	O
Do	O
you	O
come	O
from	O
another	O
planet	O

"	O

But	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
reply	O

He	O
tossed	O
his	O
head	O
gently	O
,	O
without	O
taking	O
his	O
eyes	O
from	O
my	O
plane	O
:	O
"	O
It	O

And	O
he	O
sank	O
into	O
a	O
reverie	O
,	O
which	O
lasted	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
taking	O
my	O
sheep	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
,	O
he	O
buried	O
himself	O
in	O
the	O
contemplation	O
of	O
his	O
treasure	O

You	O
can	O
imagine	O
how	O
my	O
curiosity	O
was	O
aroused	O
by	O
this	O
half	O
-	O
confidence	O
about	O
the	O
"	O
other	O
planets	O

"	O

I	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
effort	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
more	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O

"	O
My	O
little	O
man	O

where	O

After	O
a	O
reflective	O
silence	O
he	O
answered	O
:	O
"	O
The	O
thing	O
that	O
is	O
so	O
good	O
about	O

That	O

And	O
if	O
you	O
are	O

I	O
will	O

you	O
a	O

so	O
that	O
you	O

tie	O
him	O

the	O
day	O

a	O

him	O
to	O

But	O
the	O
little	O
prince	O
seemed	O
shocked	O
by	O
this	O
offer	O
:	O
"	O
Tie	O
him	O

a	O
queer	O
idea	O

"	O
But	O
if	O
you	O

I	O
said	O

"	O
he	O
will	O

off	O

My	O

broke	O
into	O
another	O

of	O

where	O

with	O
